# AggregateLynx

AggregateLynx is a Data Aggregator built on-top of Hadoop (though it can be used independently). AggregateLynx is made up of several subprojects:

1. [AggregateServer](https://github.com/maheshkhanwalkar/AggregateServer) - the actual server
2. [AggregateAPI](https://github.com/maheshkhanwalkar/AggregateAPI) - Java API for communicating with the AggregateServer
